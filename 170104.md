IOS study :

problem : pod command not found 

solution :

cocoapods not installed in os

run cmd --- >   sudo gem install cocoapods

it'll take time


trying google cast sdk :

actual sdk written in obj c

tried 

https://github.com/juantudor/CastHelloVideo-swift

in project root dir 

cmd -> pod install

then open .xworkspace file

problem faced :

buttonWithType is unavailable: use object construction UIButton(type:)

solution:

The convenience initializer for UIButton has changed.

```swift
convenience init(type buttonType: UIButtonType)
Swift 3:

let btn = UIButton(type: .system) // note the lower case s
Swift 2.x:

let btn = UIButton(type: .System)

```

** can't experiemnt as no chromecast

*** tried IMA sdk swift

Proof:

https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci220s1t/lectures/lecturenotes/GG-lectures/BigOhexamples.pdf


Example:

```java
int recursiveFun1(int n)
    {
        if (n <= 0)
        return 1;
    else
        return 1 + recursiveFun1(n-1);
}

int recursiveFun2(int n)
{
    if (n <= 0)
        return 1;
    else
        return 1 + recursiveFun2(n-5);
}

int recursiveFun3(int n)
{
    if (n <= 0)
        return 1;
    else
        return 1 + recursiveFun3(n/5);
}

void recursiveFun4(int n, int m, int o)
{
    if (n <= 0)
    {
        printf("%d, %d\n",m, o);
    }
    else
    {
        recursiveFun4(n-1, m+1, o);
        recursiveFun4(n-1, m, o+1);
    }
}

int recursiveFun5(int n)
{
    for (i = 0; i < n; i += 2) {
        // do something
    }

    if (n <= 0)
        return 1;
    else
        return 1 + recursiveFun5(n-5);
}
```

The time complexity, in Big O notation, for each function, is in numerical order:

The first function is being called recursively n times before reaching base case so its O(n), often called linear.

The second function is called n-5 for each time, so we deduct five from n before calling the function, but n-5 is also O(n). (Actually called order of n/5 times. And, O(n/5) = O(n) ).

This function is log(n) base 5, for every time we divide by 5 before calling the function so its O(log(n))(base 5), often called logarithmic and most often Big O notation and complexity analysis uses base 2.

In the fourth, it's O(2^n), or exponential, since each function call calls itself twice unless it has been recursed n times.

As for the last function, the for loop takes n/2 since we're increasing by 2, and the recursion take n-5 and since the for loop is called recursively therefore the time complexity is in (n-5) *(n/2) = (2n-10) * n = 2n^2- 10n, due to Asymptotic behavior and worst case scenario considerations or the upper bound that big O is striving for, we are only interested in the largest term so O(n^2).
